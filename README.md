# ChessAnalysis

This code plots the evaluation graph of any standard chess game. Uses multiprocessing to speed up the process.
This script was made because:
* I do not know of any offline gui chess software which plots analysis graph of a game
* Chess.com free version only provides depth 10 analysis graph. Even the premium version depth 18 analysis seems weak to me. I need at least 30.
* Lichess does not provide analysis graph for imported games. It does provide analysis graphs of games played on thier platform but those again are too weak to detect brilliant moves if any.
* The reason I need analysis graph is because I sometimes only want to know where I went wrong and doing the self analysis move by move takes buttload of time.
